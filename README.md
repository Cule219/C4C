# C4C

While I initially thought of writing both JS and Node.js solutions(hence why you will find javascript_solution and node_solution folders in the submission) writing and commenting Node.js solution took me close to 40ish minutes to write so I skipped the Vanilla JS solution. 

Installation instructions:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Download the solution and unpack it
3. Once inside the downloaded folder run following command in terminal
   \$ cd nodejs_solution && npm install
4. Once all the prerequisites are installed, run
   \$ node node.js
5. If successful you should see output in your terminal as well as new file in the nodejs_solution folder.

Thank you for your time and I hope to get the chance to meet you!
